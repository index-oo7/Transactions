# Transactions
Managing transactions within payment account.

The application implements transactions within the payment account. 
It updates the balance of the account, as well as the balance of inflows and outflows, with each completed transaction.
Within the application, it is possible to search for transactions by transaction reference number and to sort by transaction date in ascending and descending order.
If the transaction was made in the last week, it will be displayed in the "Recent Transactions" section. The complete list of transactions can be sorted by date in ascending and descending order.
